Description: X2go server daemon scripts
 X2go is a serverbased computing environment with
    - session resuming
    - low bandwith support
    - LDAP support
    - client side mass storage mounting support
    - audio support
    - authentication by smartcard and USB stick
 .
 This package contains the main daemon and tools for
 X2go server-side session administrations.
 .
 The x2goserver package provides full functionality
 for running the X2go project's legacy X2go client
 (x2goclient) on the client-side.
 .
 However, if you intend using other client implementations 
 of X2go make sure that you also have X2go server
 extensions package (x2goserver-extensions) installed.

Description: X2go server daemon scripts (extensions)
 X2go is a serverbased computing environment with
    - session resuming
    - low bandwith support
    - LDAP support
    - client side mass storage mounting support
    - audio support
    - authentication by smartcard and USB stick
 .
 The X2go server extension namespace offers contributors
 to add script functionality to X2go that is not
 needed/ignored by the legacy X2go client (x2goclient).
 .
 Make sure you have this package installed on your server
 if you want non-legacy X2go clients to be able to
 access your server without lack of features.
