# Uncomment to disable GLX, the old mesa version is hopelessly outdated anyways.
# Unbreaks the gnome3 control center

#X2GO_NXAGENT_DEFAULT_OPTIONS+=" -extension GLX"

# Launch X2Go's X-server x2goagent with option "-nolisten tcp".
#
# This is the default setting and the X2Go developers really recommend not to
# touch this. However, if you play with this (i.e. if you comment it out) you
# should really know what you are doing.
#
# For everyone else: don't touch the line below!!!
X2GO_NXAGENT_DEFAULT_OPTIONS+=" -nolisten tcp"

# Enforce clipboard behaviour in X2Go sessions globally (for all connecting clients)
# Possible values for the -clipboard option: both, server, client, none
# If this option stays commented out, clients can choose the sessions' clipboard behaviour...
#X2GO_NXAGENT_DEFAULT_OPTIONS+=" -clipboard both"

# BIG-REQUESTS can be problematic. Older versions of nx-libs did not implement
# this extension correctly, leading to all sorts of weird crashes if left
# enabled.
# Newer versions should handle this extension much better, but if you see
# crashes related to BIG-REQUESTS, uncomment this line to disable the
# extension.
#X2GO_NXAGENT_DEFAULT_OPTIONS+=" -extension BIG-REQUESTS"

# Extra nxagent nx/nx options, separated by commas.  For example: sleep=0
