# x2goserver-pyhoca
This folder contains the neccessary placeholder and feature definitions to execute the pyhoca client side.

 * bin 

   placeholder folder

 * man

   man page documentations

 * share

   feature definition itself, seems empty so far, maybe only to use the feature installation process?
