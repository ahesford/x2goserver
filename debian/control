Description: X2go server daemon scripts
 X2go is a server based computing environment with
    - session resuming
    - low bandwith support
    - LDAP support
    - client side mass storage mounting support
    - audio support
    - authentication by smartcard and USB stick
 .
 This package contains the main daemon and tools for
 X2go server-side session administrations.
 .
 The x2goserver package provides full functionality
 for running the X2go project's legacy X2go client
 (x2goclient) on the client-side.
 .
 However, if you intend using other client implementations 
 of X2go make sure that you also have X2go server
 extensions package (x2goserver-extensions) installed.

 The X2go server printing package provides
 client-side printing support for X2go.
 .
 This package has to be installed on X2go servers
 that shall be able to pass X2go print jobs on
 to the X2go client.
 .
 This package co-operates with the cups-x2go CUPS
 backend. If CUPS server and X2go server are hosted
 on different machines, then make sure you install
 this package on the X2go server/s (and the cups-x2go
 package on the CUPS server).

 startups and many more Xsession related features on 
 X2go session login automagically.
